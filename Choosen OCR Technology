I have been using both in some research for almost a year. I can say that each has its own perfect use.

PaddleOCR PROs:

If the text is rotated in non-90-degree rotations, PaddleOCR can still detect some text correctly, but Tesseract cannot do this even if OSD is used.
You can use the detection results to fix the rotation, but Tesseract is likely to retrieve non-sense results.
PaddleOCR works better than Tesseract when images in RGB/BGR if you can't binarize your image.
Tesseract PROs:

PaddleOCR has serious problems with detecting spaces even after manipulating the parameters, but they are working on fixing this in the next upgrade. Tesseract doesn't have significant spaces problems.
Tesseract is better in terms of processing scanned documents.
Image segmentation modes are to the rescue and help a lot with improving the results.
Tesseract results on binarized images with long text are usually better than PaddleOCR.
Tesseract is far better at detecting symbols.
Tesseract is faster on CPU.
In short, using Tesseract would be perfect for scanned documents and PaddleOCR for general computer vision projects.
